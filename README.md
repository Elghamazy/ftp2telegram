# ftp2telegram

Sends your FTP uploaded images, animations, videos, audios or even documents to the specified Chat-Ids.
This might come in handy, if you have a intercom which just can upload images from the camera to an FTP instead of
sending it by mail, or if you have a scanner which only supports FTP upload
